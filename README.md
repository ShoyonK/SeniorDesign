The code for this is not available as there is an NDA but there is a powerpoint displaying our work

• Mobile operator have a vital need to be able to forecast the network capabilities, not only 
for offline operations (e.g.: optimization and capacity planning) but also to support 
fulfillment and orchestration activities, .e.g.: to implement what-if scenarios, adapt
thresholds, implement feasibility tests, etc. 

• Due to the dynamism and agility required to implement 5G and 5G Slicing services, one 
critical use case for the mobile operators is to in an agile and automated way, to accept 
orders for services on top of shared resources. 

• The acceptance of these orders is fully dependent on the underlay bottlenecks (e.g.: 
compute in the telco cloud infrastructure, mobile backhaul maximum throughput) and its 
capabilities to deliver the service during its lifecycle. Because the network is very 
dynamic, the Network Management Systems (NMS) and Operations Support System 
(OSS) systems need to forecast the resources usage and its ability to support all the 
requirements. 

• Due to the amount metrics (KPIs, NQIs, SQIs) available in the 5G NMS and OSS 
systems the objective is to configure and parametrize automatically (dependent on the 
time series nature) forecasting models : ARIMA, SARIMAX, SARIMA-GARCH, 
XGBoost, LSTM, NNETAR, etc
